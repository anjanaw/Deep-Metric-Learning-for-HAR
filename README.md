# Deep Metric Learners for Human Activity Recognition
Here we performe a comparative evaluation of Siamese Neural Networks, Triplet Networks and Matching Networks for the task of Human Activity Recognition using two HAR datasets: SelfBACK and PAMAP2

Publication: "Human activity recognition with deep metric learners" at the 27th International conference on case-based reasoning workshop (ICCBR-WS19), co-located with the 27th International conference on case-based reasoning (ICCBR19)
